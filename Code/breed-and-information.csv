Alaskan Klee Kai,"Small, smart, and energetic, the Alaskan Klee Kai is a relatively new breed that looks like a smaller version of the Siberian Husky, and even the name “Klee Kai” comes from an Inuit term meaning “small dog.”

While Alaskan Klee Kais may resemble larger Husky breeds, they have some key differences, especially when it comes to temperament, that distinguish it from its ancestor working class dogs of the north. This breed is more suited to the life of a companion, though the Alaskan Klee Kai shares the high energy of the Huskies and demands plenty of exercise.

Alaskan Malamute,"The Alaskan Malamute features a powerful, sturdy body built for stamina and strength. It reigns as one of the oldest dog breeds whose original looks have not been significantly altered. This intelligent canine needs a job and consistent leadership to avoid becoming bored or challenging to handle.

Novice owners, beware. Dogs of this breed are sensitive and need plenty of companionship and open space. They are not well-suited to apartment life, and they are certainly high-shedding pooches who need plenty of grooming to keep their coats healthy. Expect to clean up dog hair all year long, and especially during shedding season. Alaskan Malamutes are high-energy dogs, and therefore require vigorous exercise. If you plan to leave them home while you’re at work, you may see some anxious, destructive behavior. A dog walker or pet sitter during the day is practically a must if you can’t be home, yourself.

Novice owners beware. Not only are dogs of this breed big; they’re known to be stubborn. Anatolian Shepherd Dogs require firm, consistent trainers with experience handling dogs. Also, while grooming requirements are fairly minimal, owners should have the vacuum on standby. Be ready to clean up all the fur they shed throughout the year.


A trained and well-socialized Anatolian Shepherd is a friend and guardian for anyone they consider to be their “flock,” which includes the human members of their family. They are even friendly with their human children, though their size makes it easy for them to knock over a kid during vigorous play. They may also chase other pets or animals if they owners don’t train them properly. Therefore, socialization and behavior training should start early on, ideally in puppyhood. If you’re willing to stay firm with training, you have the strength to handle a large pooch, and you’re willing to put in the time and dedication, an Anatolian Shepherd Dog will be your friend and guardian for life.",L,,,,,,,,,

An Akita is bound to shed quite a bit, and you may be wiping some drool from their face if you bring one home. Certainly, owners should be prepared for some cleanup.

The Bernese Mountain Dog comes from the canton of Bern, hence his name. They’re a large and sturdy dog breed, with a friendly and calm disposition, and they’re also well-suited to conformation, obedience, tracking, herding, and carting competitions.

A novice dog owner might be attracted to this breed’s friendly disposition, intelligence, and highly trainable nature. However, first-time dog owners should beware. The Bernese Mountain Dog’s size and high energy can make handling difficult. Thus, they don’t appreciate being cooped up in apartments all day. They shed a lot, and they tend to need the drool wiped from their faces every once in a while. Dogs of this breed are great watchdogs, but that also means they have a tendency to bark–loudly. They may want to chase smaller animals and play roughly, even though they are quite gentle when fully mature and trained properly.


Although, for an experienced owner who can match the Bernese’s energy, provide open space, keep up with grooming, and dedicate time and effort to training, this breed will show unconditional love and loyalty. A well-trained Bernese makes an excellent companion that will adore the whole family. They love kids and will even greet newcomers to the home warmly, so long as they’ve had adequate socialization training. There aren’t many breeds with a greater predisposition for friendliness.

Even though the breed has “Blue” in its name, Blue Lacys can also have red or tri-colored coats, though they all carry the blue color gene. The “Lacy” in the breed’s name does not refer to the dog’s appearance at all, but rather comes from the name of the family that first created the breed.

The Blue Lacy was developed in the 1800s to help with herding, hunting, and ranch work in Texas. These dogs are hardy, adaptable, and able to learn quickly, though their high intensity and energy level make them ill-suited for apartment life or novice owners.


Blue Lacys can make great family dogs and expert watchdogs with firm training, but they are sensitive and don’t respond well to punishment.

So be careful and take extra precautions.

Bockers love endless play sessions and activity. They should not be left alone for long periods. Multiple pet families would be ideal. Isolation is their biggest enemy.",L,,,,,,,,,
Boerboel,"At first glance, you might think the large, intimidating Boerboel would make an excellent guard dog, and you’d be correct, but this breed is equally known for being loving, calm, and family-friendly, especially towards human children.

These gigantic protectors were bred to help farmers in South Africa defend their homesteads from hyenas, lions, and all manner of deadly wildlife while also providing invaluable companionship. The Boerboel, pronounced “boo-r-bull,” gets its name from Dutch/Afrikaans words that roughly translate to “farmer’s dog.” It is also known as the South African Mastiff, South African Boerboel, Borbull, or Bole.


Although Boerboels are generally docile, easy to groom, and have few health problems, don’t make the mistake of thinking they’re an easy breed to handle for first time owners.

They will thrive in a household with a backyard, but will also be content living in an apartment as long as the pup can burn off energy with regular walks and trips to the dog park. Make sure you have a secure yard, as they’re prone to tracking and wandering off.",L,,,,,,,,,

Lagotto Romagnolo,"Lagotto Romagnolo means “lake dog from Romagna,” which is a good name for this breed, considering these dogs were originally bred to help hunt waterfowl through the wet marshlands of Romagna in Italy. They are also known as Italian Water Dogs and Romagna Water Dogs. Today, with many of the marshlands of the breed’s homeland drained, these dogs have found a new purpose in truffle hunting. Owners can easily train them to use their super noses for scent work, and Lagottos’ thick coats help them stay warm in fall and winter while protecting them from thorns and debris as they run through forests.

They are the only dogs bred for the specific purpose of truffle hunting in modern times, and their keen sense of smell and natural tendency to dig make them experts at the task.

Their hypoallergenic coats are good for allergy sufferers, though those coats require a good deal of maintenance.

He could have a stubby tail, spindly legs, a giant spot over his left eye — or all three. A divine inspiration, the mixed breed is gloriously, wonderfully someone else’s design.

And as the ultimate family dog, the mixed breed excels where the purebred lacks.

Bred solely to be companions, Shih Tzus are affectionate, happy, outgoing house dogs who love nothing more than to follow their people from room to room. Since ancient times, they’ve made themselves comfortable on the laps of people from all walks of life, even emperors!

Silken Windhound,"The Silken Windhound is an affectionate, playful, and eager-to-please dog breed that is easily trained and loves families, including those with small children and pets. In fact, their affectionate nature makes them poor watchdogs. That’s because they are likely to react to strangers with warm greetings instead of barks or growls. As a relatively new breed, the Silken Windhound is not recognized by the American Kennel Club, though it was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 2011 and appears in shows and competitions around the world.

Silken Windhounds can be trained for obedience, agility, and dog sports. Furthermore, they tend to pick up such training quickly and easily with their intelligence and desire to please the humans that they are close to. However their high prey drive must be redirected into positive behavior or they may bolt after small animals and wander.


Although these dogs are easygoing most of the time and are happy to curl up on the couch with their families, they also have bursts of high energy and require exercise in the form of at least one long walk or run per day. If their exercise needs are met, they are happy to adapt to almost any living situation, including apartment life.

Their long, beautiful coats come in a variety of patterns and colors, and despite their luxurious looks, they are surprisingly easy to maintain and do not shed excessively. Silken Windhounds make great, active family companions for novice and experienced owners, alike, and their long life span will keep them around for many years of love and affection.",,,,,,,,,,
