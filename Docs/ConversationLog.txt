> please give me info on a bavarian mountain scent hound
The Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound is a purebred dog originally from Germany. These pups are loyal, intelligent, and reserved, which are some of the best qualities for a Hound dog breed.

The Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound goes by a few other names, including Bavarian Mountain Scenthound and Bayerischer Gebirgsschwei. Despite being a very rare breed, you can try and find these adorable pooches in local shelters or breed specific rescues, so remember to adopt! Don’t shop!


These reserved pups are very loyal to their pet parents and would fit great with families with children or larger households. They are a quiet breed but are very wary towards strangers or anyone theydon’t know approaching them or their humans. If you want a loyal pup who likes to be active and will love you unconditionally, the Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound may be the right dog for you!
